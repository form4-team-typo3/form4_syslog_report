# form4_syslog_report

## Introduction / What does it do ?

The extension adds a task to send an email with reports of the system log modul.
The email will look like in the picure below.


This extension is a support module for editors to manage pages and content for new sites and add some visual aids in the front- and back-end.

For that it extends the pages with some editorial features (a check-box to mark a page as final , and a text field to add editorial comment if necessary). It also comes with a module which allows to see/manage open and closed changes with direct links to page. You can add a static template for the front-end to render a marker in front-end which shows if a page is already marked as final, too.
